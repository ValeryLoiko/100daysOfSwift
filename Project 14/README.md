# Project 14 - Whack-a-Penguin

## Challenges
One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try your new knowledge to make sure you fully understand what’s going on:

Record your own voice saying "Game over!" and have it play when the game ends.
When showing “Game Over” add an SKLabelNode showing their final score.
Use SKEmitterNode to create a smoke-like effect when penguins are hit, and a separate mud-like effect when they go into or come out of a hole.
